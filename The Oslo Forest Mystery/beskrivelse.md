## Task: The Oslo Forest Mystery

In the lush forests surrounding Oslo, where trees grow tall and wildlife thrives, an unexpected mystery has arisen. The beautiful binary trees that once symbolized harmony in the forest have been transformed into confusing reflections of themselves! This has caused confusion among the forest's creatures, who now grope through the foliage in search of solutions.

Your task is to help restore balance to the forest by implementing a function that can reverse this perplexing state and bring the trees back to their original condition.

### Task Instructions:

1. Implement a method `invertTree`, which takes the root node of a binary tree and reverses the structure so that the left child becomes the right child and vice versa.

2. Test your implementation by using the `print_tree_array` function to print both the original and the inverted tree.

Contribute to restoring peace in the Oslo forest area, and let the trees once again be a source of harmony and beauty for all the forest's creatures!
