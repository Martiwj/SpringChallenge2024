Martin and Sebastian have been using their ultra-secure, nearly impossible-to-crack code to exchange messages. 

However, they recently discovered that someone—possibly Amadu—has been trying to decipher their conversations. In a clever twist, Martin and Sebastian decide to outsmart their eavesdropper by sending a message encoded with a simpler code. The message is encoded by following each vowel with an "r" and the vowel itself, and following each consonant with an "o" and the consonant itself. Spaces are left unchanged. For example, `hello world` will be changed to `hoherelolloloro woworororloldod`
